# Technical Documentation project using HTML and CSS describing CSS flexboxes.

Demonstrates features of HTML and CSS such as headers, fixed nav bar, sections, lists, code boxes, paragraphs and media-queries.

You can see this project live at the following URL:

This was intended to be a cheat sheet for CSS flexboxes AND grids but I have decided to create a separate CSS grid cheatsheet page that will eventually be linked in here.

## Content adapted from:
https://mastery.games/flexboxzombies/ (great learning resource)
https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/flexbox-the-ultimate-css-flex-cheatsheet/
https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
https://www.ostraining.com/blog/webdesign/css-flexbox-the-flex-shorthand-property/

Tested with JS under freecodecamp.org parameters.




## CURRENT VERSION:

- Functions as CSS flexbox cheat sheet
- Passes JS Tests


## TO DO:

- Refer to conclusions for possible improvements.
